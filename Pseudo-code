Pseudo-code for File Integrity Checker

# --- Hashing Function ---
def hash_file(filepath):
    # Create a sha256 hash object
    # Open the file in binary read mode ('rb')
    # Read the file in chunks to handle large files
    # Update the hash object with each chunk
    # Return the final hexadecimal hash digest

# --- Baseline Generation Function ---
def generate_baseline(directory_to_scan):
    # Create an empty dictionary for the baseline
    # Use os.walk() to go through every file in the directory
        # For each file, call hash_file() to get its hash
        # Add the {filepath: hash} pair to the dictionary
    # Open a baseline file (e.g., 'baseline.json') for writing
    # Use json.dump() to save the dictionary to the file
    # Print a success message

# --- Integrity Check Function ---
def check_integrity(directory_to_scan):
    # Load the baseline from 'baseline.json' using json.load()
    # Perform a new scan of the directory to get current hashes
    # Compare the new scan with the baseline data
    # Create lists for modified, new, and deleted files
    # Print a report of the findings

# --- Main Execution Block ---
def main():
    # Set up argparse to handle commands ('generate', 'check') and arguments ('--dir')
    # Parse the arguments provided by the user
    
    # If the user chose 'generate':
        # Call generate_baseline() with the specified directory
    # If the user chose 'check':
        # Call check_integrity() with the specified directory

# Run the main function
